# The GxP Manifesto

## The Problem: Knowledge Behind a Paywall

For too long, the "correct" way to validate pharmaceutical systems has been treated as a proprietary secret.

If you want to know how to comply with 21 CFR Part 11 or Annex 11, you typically have two bad options:

1.  **Pay a Fortune:** Buy expensive access to "industry guides" from large, gatekeeping organizations.
2.  **Hire the Gatekeepers:** Pay consultants thousands of dollars a day to implement "standard" templates that should be public knowledge.

This creates a two-tier system. Big Pharma can afford to buy certainty. Startups, scale-ups, and innovators are left guessing, often over-documenting out of fear because they can't afford to see the "standard."

**We believe that safety and compliance should not be a luxury product.**

## The Solution: Open Source Validation

We are applying the Open Source philosophy (the same one that built the Internet/Linux) to Pharmaceutical Validation.

We believe that **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**, **Validation Plans**, and **Risk Assessments** should be:

- **Free:** Accessible to every engineer, quality manager, and scientist.
- **Transparent:** No "black box" logic. You can see exactly why a rule exists.
- **Version Controlled:** Managed with Git, not buried in email chains.

## The Power of 1,000 SMEs

The old model relies on a small committee of "gurus" writing standards every 5 years. The world moves too fast for that.

**GxP-Blueprint is building a repository of knowledge crowdsourced from 1,000s of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) around the world.**

Instead of one consultant's opinion, we want the collective wisdom of the engineer in Ireland, the QA manager in Boston, and the Validation Lead in Singapore. When 1,000 experts review a standard, it becomes more robust, more practical, and more compliant than anything a closed committee could produce.

## Our Pledge

1.  **No Paywalls:** This knowledge base will always be free to access.
2.  **Community Driven:** We accept Pull Requests. If you see a better way to validate, submit it.

**We are not just documenting the standard. Together, we are setting it.**
