# The GxP Charter

## The Problem: Knowledge Stuck in Silos
For decades, practical validation know‑how has lived in closed committees, proprietary binders, or the heads of a few “gurus.” That slows everyone down and leaves teams guessing.

## The Solution: A Commons for GxP
We’re treating validation guidance like open-source code: public, inspectable, versioned, and continuously improved.

**Our principles**
- **Open access:** Content is free to read and reuse.
- **Transparent logic:** Every rule is explained, not hidden.
- **Version-controlled:** Changes are tracked in Git; history is never lost.
- **Merit wins:** Great ideas are accepted based on quality, not seniority or job title.

## The Power of Many
We invite engineers, QA, QC, validation leads, regulators-in-training, and implementers worldwide to contribute. Diverse, real-world inputs make the standards sharper and more practical than any single-author document.

## Our Pledge
1. **Always open contribution:** Pull requests are welcome; discussion stays public.  
2. **Meritocratic review:** Ideas are judged on evidence and clarity, not résumés.  
3. **Continuous improvement:** When someone shows a better way, we adopt it—quickly.  

Together we’re not just sharing the standard—we’re building it in the open.
