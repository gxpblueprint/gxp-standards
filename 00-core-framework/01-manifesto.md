# Why We Validate (Not Just Document)

## The Problem
The industry has confused **compliance** with **paperwork**. We spend thousands of hours generating screenshots and static documents that no one reads, purely out of fear of regulatory observation.

## The Solution
We believe in **Value-Based Compliance**.
1. Focus on Patient Safety, not Auditor Comfort.
2. Critical Thinking over Cut-and-Paste.
3. Open Standards over Proprietary Secrets.
