# 01-SOP-GDP-Core: Good Documentation Practices for Paper (Manual) Records

> **Purpose of this document:** Provide a complete, practical, and regulatory‑aligned handbook for every employee who writes, reviews, or archives paper GMP records. This SOP is intentionally detailed so it can be used at the desk or on the shop floor as the single source of truth.

---

## 1. Purpose
Establish Good Documentation Practices (GDP) for all **paper (manual) GMP records** so that data are Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, and Available (ALCOA+). These practices protect product quality, patient safety, and regulatory compliance.

## 2. Scope
- Applies to **all paper GMP documents** generated in manufacturing, packaging, warehousing, laboratories, engineering/maintenance, calibration, quality assurance/control, and training at this site.
- Includes: batch production and packaging records, logbooks, laboratory notebooks/worksheets, labels and status tags, cleaning/temperature/environmental logs, deviation/CAPA forms, training records, and any controlled paper template.
- Excludes electronic or hybrid records (covered separately under computerized systems SOPs); however, printed outputs that become part of a paper record (e.g., instrument printouts) are in scope for attachment, labeling, and review.

## 3. References
- **FDA** 21 CFR 210–211 (notably 211.180, 211.182, 211.186, 211.188, 211.194)
- **EU GMP / EudraLex Vol. 4** Chapter 4 (Documentation) and Annex 15 (Qualification & Validation)
- **PIC/S PI 041-1 (2021)** Good Practices for Data Management and Integrity
- **WHO** Good Documentation Practices (TRS 1033 Annex 4; TRS 996 Annex 5)
- Site Quality Manual and Master Validation Plan (for alignment of retention and review expectations)

## 4. Definitions
- **ALCOA+:** Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available.
- **Controlled document:** Approved, versioned, and issued document (SOP, master form, batch record, logbook).
- **True copy:** Verified copy that fully preserves content and meaning of the original.
- **Late entry:** An entry made after the activity; must be labeled as such, dated, timed, and explained.
- **Void record:** A page or form rendered unusable; it is crossed diagonally, marked “VOID,” signed/dated, retained, and replaced with a new issued copy.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities
| Role | Key GDP Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| All personnel | Record in real time, legibly, with indelible ink; follow correction rules; never use uncontrolled forms; safeguard issued documents. |
| Supervisors/Managers | Ensure staff are trained; check contemporaneous completion; refuse/return records with GDP gaps; arrange second-person verifications where required. |
| Quality Unit (QA/QC) | Owns GDP system; approves templates; issues and reconciles controlled copies/logbooks; maintains signature/initial log; reviews/approves completed records; investigates discrepancies (per 21 CFR 211.192); controls archives and destruction. |
| Document Control / Archivist | Maintains master document list; numbers and issues logbooks/forms; tracks issuance and return; manages secure storage and retrieval. |
| Training | Provides initial and periodic GDP training; maintains GDP-compliant training records; triggers refresher after observations or regulation changes. |

## 6. Document Types and Format Requirements
### 6.1 Batch Production & Packaging Records (BPRs) – 21 CFR 211.186/211.188
- Controlled copy of approved master; each page pre-numbered “Page X of Y” and carries product, strength (if applicable), batch/lot number, and document ID.
- Fields for **date, time, step performed, equipment ID, materials, performer, verifier** (where required), and space for comments/deviations.
- Attachments (labels, printouts) must be signed/initialed and dated by the person attaching.

### 6.2 Equipment / Room Logbooks – 21 CFR 211.182
- Bound, pre-numbered; labeled with equipment/room ID and logbook ID; start/end dates recorded.
- Entries in chronological order for use, cleaning, maintenance, calibration; performer and verifier sign/initial and date each entry.

### 6.3 Laboratory Notebooks / Worksheets – 21 CFR 211.194
- Controlled notebooks or issued worksheets with unique ID; include sample ID, test method, instruments, raw data, calculations, results.
- Analyst signs/dates each test section; reviewer signs/dates independent review. Instrument printouts labeled with sample ID, test/date, analyst initials, and attached.

### 6.4 Cleaning, Environmental, Temperature, and Utility Logs
- Pre-defined columns (date/time, location/equipment, activity/result, performer, verifier as applicable). No blanks; use “N/A” with initials/date when not applicable.

### 6.5 Labels and Status Tags
- Handwritten fields completed with indelible ink; include date/time and initials/signature. Errors corrected per Section 10 or label replaced; voided labels retained/reconciled.

### 6.6 Forms/Templates (Deviation, CAPA, Training, Dispensing, Reconciliation)
- Controlled version and form ID on each page. Issued by Document Control; photocopying uncontrolled forms is prohibited. Unused sections marked “N/A,” initialed/dated.

## 7. Core GDP Rules (Applicable to every entry)
1) **Ink & Legibility:** Indelible blue or black ink only. Writing must be readable by others. No pencil, erasable ink, gel pens that smear, correction fluid/tape, or overwriting.  
2) **Timeliness (Contemporaneous):** Record at the time of activity. No backdating or future dating. If a late entry is unavoidable, label “Late entry,” add current date/time and brief reason.  
3) **Completeness:** Never leave blanks. Enter data or “N/A” and initial/date. Use one line per event.  
4) **Accuracy:** Record actual observed values with correct units and required decimal places. No ditto marks. Only approved abbreviations (see Appendix A).  
5) **Attributable:** Every entry signed/initialed and dated by the person who performed it; second signature where verification is required.  
6) **Originals:** Record directly on the controlled form/logbook; no transcribing from scrap paper. If scratch notes were unavoidably used, attach them and transcribe with linkage.  
7) **Enduring:** Protect records from damage (spills, smudge); if damaged, follow void/true-copy process.  
8) **Available:** Keep issued documents secured but accessible to authorized staff; do not remove from site without QA approval.

## 8. Detailed Procedures by Document Type
### 8.1 Batch Records – Execution
1. Verify issued copy matches batch number and revision; check page count “X of Y.”  
2. Before starting, fill header fields (product, batch, equipment IDs as applicable).  
3. For each step: record date/time, actual values, performer initials/signature; capture verifier signature where required (weigh/dispense, critical additions, yield calculations, line clearance).  
4. If an attachment is added (printout, label), write batch number and step reference on the attachment, sign/date across the edge, and affix securely.  
5. When a field is not applicable, write “N/A,” initial/date.  
6. At step completion, review for blanks and legibility before proceeding.  
7. At batch end, performer performs completeness check; supervisor performs second check; QA reviews per Section 12.

### 8.2 Equipment / Cleaning / Utility Logbooks
1. Confirm logbook ID and equipment/room match the asset being used.  
2. Enter date/time, activity (use, cleaning, maintenance, calibration), product/batch (if applicable), performer initials/signature.  
3. Where required, verifier initials/signature immediately after performer entry.  
4. If a page is full, continue on next page; do not insert loose sheets.

### 8.3 Laboratory Records
1. Use controlled worksheet or bound notebook page; record sample ID, method, instrument ID, reagent/standard IDs, expiry dates where applicable.  
2. Record raw data directly (weights, volumes, instrument readings). Show calculations or reference attached calculation sheet; sign/initial and date each calculation.  
3. Attach instrument printouts labeled with sample ID, date/time, analyst initials; sign/date across the attachment.  
4. Reviewer signs/dates independent review; critical calculations may require second verification.

### 8.4 Labels / Status Tags
1. Complete all fields in indelible ink: status, product/material, lot/batch, date/time, initials/signature.  
2. If an error occurs, do **not** overwrite. Cross out with single line, initial/date, add corrected label; retain voided label with the record or reconciliation sheet.

### 8.5 Controlled Forms (Deviation, CAPA, Training, Dispensing)
1. Confirm correct version ID; pages numbered “X of Y.”  
2. Complete each field; if not applicable, “N/A” + initial/date.  
3. For training forms, both trainee and trainer sign/date.  
4. For dispensing/reconciliation, ensure issued/returned quantities balance; both operator and verifier sign/date.

## 9. Prohibited Practices (must never occur)
- Pencil, erasable ink, correction fluid/tape, or scraping/obliteration.  
- Backdating, future dating, or signing for someone else.  
- Ditto marks (“ ”) or arrows implying “same as above.”  
- Unapproved abbreviations or symbols.  
- Uncontrolled photocopies or home-made forms.  
- Detached pages without control; inserting loose pages into bound logbooks.  
- Leaving blank lines/fields in GMP sections.  
- Destroying or discarding original records (use void/true-copy process only).

## 10. Corrections and Error Handling
1. **Simple error:** Single-line strike-through; original must remain legible. Write correct entry nearby; initial/date; add brief reason if not obvious.  
2. **Late entry:** Label “Late entry,” record current date/time, reference original activity date/time, provide reason; initial/sign.  
3. **Wrong page/major error:** Mark page “VOID,” diagonal line optional, initial/date; keep in sequence. Rewrite on new issued page and reference the voided page ID.  
4. **Attachments corrected:** If an attached printout is wrong, mark “VOID” on the attachment, initial/date, keep it, and attach the corrected printout with linkage.  
5. **Scribes:** Only when performer cannot write (e.g., aseptic). Scribe writes entry contemporaneously, signs/dates, and notes “Recorded by [scribe] for [operator].” Operator countersigns/date ASAP.  
6. **Error impacting quality/compliance:** Notify supervisor and QA immediately; log as deviation per 21 CFR 211.192; quarantine affected product if applicable.

## 11. Signatures, Initials, and Dates
- Use the site-standard date format (e.g., **DD-MMM-YYYY**, optional 24‑h time).  
- Each person’s initials and signature must be in the controlled Signature/Initial Log.  
- Performer and verifier sign immediately after completing/verifying the step.  
- If initials are used within a record, a full signature and printed name must appear at least once in that record.  
- No signature stamps unless specifically approved and controlled by QA.

## 12. Document Control and Issuance
1. **Version control:** QA approves templates; obsolete versions withdrawn and marked “OBSOLETE” then archived.  
2. **Issuance:** QA/Doc Control issues batch records, logbooks, and controlled forms; records issuance in an issuance log (document ID, version, copy number, recipient, date, page count).  
3. **Pagination:** Every page carries document ID and “Page X of Y.” For bound logbooks, pages are pre-numbered and checked before issue.  
4. **Lost/Damaged copy:** Report immediately. QA issues replacement; original (if found) is marked “VOID” and reconciled.  
5. **Reconciliation:** For prenumbered forms/labels, reconcile used/unused/voided numbers; discrepancies investigated.

## 13. Review, Approval, and Error Resolution
1. **In-process checks:** Supervisors/QA perform spot checks for contemporaneous completion and GDP compliance.  
2. **Area review:** Performer or area owner conducts completeness check before submitting to QA.  
3. **QA review:** Checks legibility, completeness, correct corrections, signatures/dates, attachment integrity, reconciliation of pages/labels, and any deviations linked.  
4. **Post-approval discovery:** If an error is found after QA approval, create an addendum/deviation; do **not** alter the approved original. Addendum is approved by QA and linked to the record.  
5. **Periodic self-inspection:** QA trends GDP issues; triggers CAPA and refresher training when needed.

## 14. Archiving and Retention
- **Retention (minimum):**  
  - Batch/packaging/analysis records: ≥ 1 year after batch expiry **or** ≥ 5 years after QP/QA release (whichever is longer).  
  - Equipment/logbooks/maintenance/calibration: ≥ 5 years.  
  - Training records: duration of employment + ≥ 3 years.  
  - Deviations/CAPA: at least as long as related batch/product retention.  
  - Follow local law if longer periods are required.
- **Storage:** Secure, access-controlled archive; protected from moisture, heat, light, pests. Fire protection and off-site backup (scanned true copies) recommended.  
- **Retrieval:** Archive index maintained; sign‑out log for any removed originals; originals not taken off-site without QA authorization.  
- **Destruction:** After retention, destroy securely (shred/incinerate) with QA approval and documented destruction record.

## 15. Training
- GDP training required **before** independent GMP work; refresher at least annually or after observations/regulation changes.  
- Training records themselves must meet GDP (signed/dated by trainee and trainer, with training content and assessment where applicable).  
- Supervisors verify effectiveness (spot checks, document review trending).

## 16. Common Pitfalls & Preventive Measures
- **Illegible handwriting:** Print in block letters; reviewers flag immediately and have originator clarify with GDP-compliant correction.  
- **Blanks or missing signatures:** Use “N/A” with initials/date; reviewer checklists before QA submission.  
- **Backdating:** Strictly prohibited; use late-entry process.  
- **Unofficial notes:** Issue controlled worksheets; if a note is used, attach it and cross-reference.  
- **White-out/overwrites:** Remove such materials from GMP areas; reinforce single-line strike-through.  
- **Transposition/calculation errors:** Require second-person verification for critical values; show calculations.  
- **Ditto marks:** Repeat data explicitly.  
- **Lost pages:** Pagination and issuance logs catch gaps; investigate immediately.

## 17. GDP Quick-Reference Checklist (post-use, pre-QA)
- All fields completed or “N/A” + initials/date.  
- Dates/times present and chronological; late entries identified.  
- Corrections single-line, initialed/dated, reason where needed.  
- Performer and verifier signatures where required.  
- Attachments labeled with batch/sample ID, signed/dated, securely affixed.  
- Page numbers present and complete; no loose sheets inserted.  
- Any deviations referenced and logged.  
- Ink legible; no white-out/erasures.  
- Reconciliations (labels/forms) completed and balanced.

## 20. Issuance and Reconciliation – Step-by-Step (QA/Document Control)
1. **Prepare master:** Confirm latest approved template in DMS; verify watermark/version.  
2. **Print/issue controlled copies:** Stamp or pre-print document ID, version, copy number; confirm page count.  
3. **Log issuance:** Record in Issuance Log: date, document ID/revision, copy number, page count, recipient/area, purpose (batch number if applicable).  
4. **Hand-over:** Obtain recipient acknowledgment (initials/signature and date) on issuance log.  
5. **Return & reconcile:** Upon completion, compare returned page count to issued; verify all pages present, including voided pages and attachments.  
6. **Record reconciliation:** Document used/unused/voided numbers for prenumbered forms or labels; discrepancies trigger deviation/investigation.  
7. **Archive or reissue:** File completed originals to QA review/archive; unused controlled copies are either re-issued or destroyed with QA approval.

## 21. Handling Attachments, True Copies, and Hybrid Printouts
- **Label every attachment** with document ID/batch or sample ID, date/time, performer initials; sign/date across the edge once affixed.  
- **Thermal or unstable media:** Immediately create a **true copy** (scan or photocopy) on archival-quality paper; verify the copy against the original; sign/date “True copy of thermal original,” attach both.  
- **Oversized/continuous printouts:** Reference the attachment in the main record (e.g., “See Attachment A: HPLC chromatogram, pages 1–3”) and ensure pagination on the attachment itself.  
- **Hybrid processes:** When data originate electronically but are recorded on paper, ensure the printout is contemporaneous, complete, and authenticated with signature/date; note the electronic system ID and version if relevant.

## 22. QA Review – Expanded Checklist
QA reviewers shall, at minimum, verify:
- **Completeness:** No blanks; “N/A” justified and initialed/dated.  
- **Chronology:** Dates/times are sequential; late entries labeled.  
- **Corrections:** Single-line strike-through, legible, initialed/dated, reasons provided where needed.  
- **Attribution:** Performer and verifier signatures present; signatures match signature log.  
- **Data integrity:** No overwrites or correction fluid; numbers consistent across pages and attachments; calculations shown/checked.  
- **Reconciliation:** Page counts correct; label/form numbers reconciled; voids present and justified.  
- **Attachments:** Properly labeled, signed/dated, securely affixed; true copies where required.  
- **Linked records:** Deviations/CAPA/batch impact assessments referenced and filed.  
- **Legibility:** Entries readable by a third party; any unclear text clarified via compliant annotation.  
- **Retention readiness:** Record is clean, stable, and ready for archive.

## 23. Record Retention Matrix (minimums; adopt longer if local law requires)
| Record Type | Minimum Retention | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Batch production & packaging records | ≥1 year after expiry **or** ≥5 years after release (whichever longer) | 21 CFR 211.180; EU GMP Ch.4/Annex 15 |
| Laboratory raw data & COA | Same as associated batch; not less than 5 years | 21 CFR 211.194 |
| Equipment/cleaning/maintenance/calibration logs | ≥5 years | EU GMP Ch.4 |
| Deviation/CAPA reports | ≥5 years or linked to batch retention (longer applies) | Site policy / 211.192 |
| Training records | Employment period + ≥3 years | WHO TRS 1033 |
| Qualification/validation protocols & reports | Life of equipment/system + ≥1 year after retirement | EU GMP Annex 15 |
| Label issuance/reconciliation logs | ≥5 years | EU GMP Ch.4 |

## 24. Training Curriculum and Competency
- **Initial GDP module:** ALCOA+, prohibited practices, correction rules, signatures/initials, late-entry handling, examples of compliant/non-compliant pages.  
- **Role-specific modules:**  
  - Operators: batch record execution, line clearance sign-offs, label completion.  
  - QC analysts: raw data capture, calculations, chromatogram handling, second-person review.  
  - Maintenance: equipment logbook use, calibration records.  
  - QA/Doc Control: issuance, reconciliation, archiving, true copies, deviation linkage.  
- **Assessment:** Short quiz plus supervised practical (completing a mock record); trainer documents competence.  
- **Refresher:** Annual, or after GDP deviations/audit findings; targeted coaching for trends (e.g., illegible handwriting).

## 25. Internal Audit & Metrics
- QA conducts periodic **GDP mini-audits** (e.g., monthly spot-check of 10 records) and full self-inspections (at least annually).  
- **Metrics tracked:** number of corrections per record, late entries, missing signatures, reconciliation discrepancies, deviation triggers due to GDP.  
- **Thresholds:** Exceeding predefined limits (e.g., >3 late entries per record set) triggers CAPA and focused retraining.  
- **Reporting:** Trends presented in Management Review; actions tracked to closure.

## 26. GDP Deviation Categorization and Response
| Category | Examples | Immediate Action | Investigation Depth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Minor | One field left blank but corrected with late entry; missing unit clarified | Correct per Section 10; supervisor review | Documented note; no product impact |
| Major | Missing verifier signature on critical step; backdating suspicion; incomplete reconciliation of labels | Quarantine batch/area as applicable; notify QA; raise deviation | Full deviation per 211.192; assess product impact |
| Critical | Data falsification, destruction of originals, use of uncontrolled forms for batch data | Stop related operations; QA and management notification; potential regulatory reporting | Formal investigation; root cause/CAPA; potential lot rejection |

## 27. Examples – Good vs Poor Entries
- **Good:** “12-Feb-2026 14:05 — Added 25.0 kg Lactose Lot LAX123, Mixer M-14, speed 45 rpm, 15 min. Performed: J. Smith (JS). Verified: A. Lee (AL).”  
- **Poor:** “25kg lactose OK” (no date/time, lot, equipment, verifier; unclear performer).  
- **Good correction:** “~~3.5~~ 3.8 °C (transcription error) JS 12-Feb-2026.”  
- **Poor correction:** Number scratched out with white-out; no initials/date.

## 28. Design Controls for Forms and Logbooks
- Provide **adequate writing space** and prompts (units, decimal places).  
- Include **signature/initial blocks** and **date/time** prompts to reduce omissions.  
- Pre-print **document ID, version, and page numbers** on every page.  
- Add **“N/A” check boxes** or shaded areas for optional sections to discourage blanks.  
- Use paper stock suitable for long-term retention; avoid thermal paper where possible.

## 29. Multi-Language and Units Control
- Documents issued in the site-approved language; if bilingual, both columns must be aligned and maintained under change control.  
- Units: follow site-standard units; avoid mixed units on the same record; conversions must show calculation.  
- Decimal notation: use a dot “.” as the decimal separator unless a local standard is formally adopted and trained.

## 30. Frequently Asked Questions (Quick Answers)
- **Can I rewrite a messy page?** Yes—mark original “VOID,” keep it, and rewrite on a new issued page with cross-reference.  
- **Can I sign for someone else?** No. Each person signs their own work; countersignatures must be by the person who actually verified.  
- **What if I forgot to record time?** Add a late entry with current date/time, state the actual time of activity, and reason.  
- **What if my pen smudged?** If legible, note “ink smudge—legible” and initial/date. If not legible, treat as correction with line-out and rewrite clearly.  
- **Are sticky notes allowed?** Only as transitory aids attached to the record and referenced; transcribe immediately and retain the original note.
